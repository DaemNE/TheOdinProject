# TheOdinProject

Today, 25/08/2022, I have started my coding journey with The Odin Project.

I have started coding in april 2021 following a 1 year bootcamp Java provided by Intec Brussel.
After applying for 3 months I started working in the CCM industry to build experience in Tech.
My passion has always been to become a programmer so I decided to go Full-Stack using The Odin Project.

This repo will contain everything that the curriculum of The Odin Project has to offer.

Feel free to look through this repo to see how I have developped in writing code, adding comments and writing documentation.
